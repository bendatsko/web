## What is PathVis?

PathVis is a pathfinding algorithm visualizer with the capability to visualize multiple pathfinding algorithms, including:

- Dijkstraâ€™s
- A*
- Greedy Breadth-first
- Greedy Depth-first

In addition, PathVis includes algorithmic techniques for maze generation (such as recursive division), a pre-set formation of walls in the shape of stairs, as well as the ability to hand-draw walls and set intermediary points. This allows users to create paths that go from point A to point B to point C according to the algorithm implemented.

Additionally, PathVis serves an educational medium through which one can learn how pathfinding algorithms work (i.e. observe which algorithms are more accurate but slower, less accurate but faster, or somewhere in between). Perhaps the largest thing is it that it helps users develop a sort of algorithmic intuition. To preemptively guide the user in developing this intuition in the very beginning of the user experience, there is an included tutorial section.

## Technical Details

PathVis was written entirely in Vanilla JavaScript. UI/UX development was done in Figma, Adobe XD, and Adobe Photoshop. Hosting is provided by Netlify.
