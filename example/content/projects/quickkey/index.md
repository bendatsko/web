Quickkey is a modern and minimalist website designed to help evaluate and improve typing speed and accuracy.

### Tips and Tricks
- Want to start a test over? Hold press `restart` to get a new words set or hold shift while clicking `restart` to reset a test with the same words set. 
- Want a different test? Press `esc` at any time.

### Understanding Your Score
- **WPM (Words Per Minute)**: This is calculated by taking the total number of characters (including spaces) of words you typed correctly, dividing by five, and then dividing by the time starting from the first character typed.
- **ACC (Accuracy)**: This is the total number of characters (including spaces) of words you got right, divided by all characters in the list of words.

## Under the Hood
