### Background

Pre-emptive visualizations are powerful tools for athletes. As a swimmer, itâ€™s helpful to close your eyes and visualize the perfect race, from the initial dive to the final touch, where the ultimate goal is to replicate your ideal race in an actual race setting. In theory, this is completley feasible; however, it is a bit difficult to be sure that your visualized races actually correspond to your goal performance (whether this be characterized by a specific technique, a tempo changes, etc.) 

Hence TempoTimer was born, which attempts to act as an objective guideline for swimmers during their mental preparation journey. 

### How it Works
TempoTimer is a mobile application that functions as a [tempo trainer](https://www.finisswim.com/Tempo-Trainer-Pro) (i.e. an underwater metronome) for visualizations. It combines auditory cues with mental imagery, ensuring that each stroke visualized is in sync with the rhythm set within the app.

Simply input your goal time for a race into the TempoTimer mode and press `start`. The app will play back a start sound, swim meet ambience, indicator sounds at flip turns, and splash sounds at your chosen tempo to provide an audio cue for each arm stroke entry into the water.

By providing these sensory guides, we attempt to enhance mental race preparation by boosting confidence and minimizing uncertainties.

### Technical Details
TempoTimer is an Android application developed with Java in Android Studio using the Android SDK.
